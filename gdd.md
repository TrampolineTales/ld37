## Ludum Dare 37
##### Theme: One Room
## The Evidence Room
*Because of budget cuts, all the police department's evidence is stored in one room: "The Evidence Room"*

### Notes:
* Police officers come into the evidence room every so often to request evidence
* No evidence art, only tags
* Requests will often be vague and one must infer which piece of evidence is actually needed from tag information
* Evidence and requested evidence is pre-determined, not randomly generated
* Evidence must often be cross-referenced with files under case # to find if they're the required evidence

### Data:
* Evidence
  * Case #
  * Date
    * Format gets more confusing in later levels:
      * 12/25/89
      * Dec. '89
      * December
    * European detective swaps day/month early in career, makes note of this in Detective's Notes in casefile
  * Type
    * Sometimes vague, "Murder Weapon" instead of "Knife" and visa-versa
* Casefile
  * Newspaper article(s)
  * Interview(s)
  * Detective's Note(s)

### Vague requests/data:

* Feb. 7th = "A week before Valentine's Day"
* 32322 = "That case number with all the 2s and 3s"
