## Ludum Dare 37
##### Theme: One Room
## The Evidence Room
*Because of budget cuts, all the police department's evidence is stored in one room: "The Evidence Room"*

### Notes:
* Police officers come into the evidence room every so often to request evidence
* No evidence art, only tags
* Requests will often be vague and one must infer which piece of evidence is actually needed from tag information
* Evidence and requested evidence is pre-determined, not randomly generated
* Evidence must often be cross-referenced with files under case # to find if they're the required evidence


### Data:
* Evidence
  * Case #
  * Date
  * Notes
* Casefile
  * Newspaper article(s)
  * Interview(s)
  * Detective's Notes
